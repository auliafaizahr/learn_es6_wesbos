      const key = 'abc1234'; //const cannot be updated
      let points = 50;
      let winner = false;

      let points = 60; //it would give error bcs let cant be redeclare 

      if(points > 40) {
        let winner = true; //this will run, but for this block only
      }

      console.log(winner); //if we call winner here, the one will show up is winner on top line after points, because its  outside block scope
      
      const person = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 28
      }

      it cant be reassigned with this way : person = {name: Wesley}
      but it can be reassigne with this way : person.age = 29;
      we can make it cant be changed forever by doing this : 
      
      const wes = Object.freeze(person);

      so when we called 'wes.age = 30' to update, it wont change, wes still had age = 28
